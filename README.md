Hi (Zwe) Htet Myek Here!

Ive been working on this project since last month May 27 and the development is mostly done at June 20.
TS took me a month to build so please consider appreciating my efforts.

I started with the UI design in Figma (8 days) and the rest was the development phase.

I have no experience in js frameworks so I had to do it in the formal way using libaries such as

GSAP
ScrollTrigger
SplitText and
Lenis

Some parts in home page and the whole cart page, I used tailwind components.
The background videos, effects, images, logos, mockups, every media in this website is made from scratch using After Effect & Photoshop.

This static Kaivera website will be turned into fully working dynamic website and is now being developed currently using backends PHP and AJAX.

All the comments, suggestions and feedbacks are welcomed since I'm still new!! THANKIE <3
